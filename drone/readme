these are the equations used to represent paths for the joystick controler of the drone 
updown uses circpath parameters as the controling is based on the equation 

(x+77)^(2) + (y-266)^(2) = 60685

as updown should satisfy
 (64,64)
 (0,32)
 (-64,20)
 implimnted by
circpath 

 x^(2) + (y + 176.67)^(2) + (z + 176.67)^(2) = 62424.58
